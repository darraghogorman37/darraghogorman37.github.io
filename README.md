# Your Project's Name TEMP

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

# All-in-Gym Website

This is a website for a commercial gym located in Dublin, Ireland. The website attracts new members for the business' owners by providing key relevant information to potential members in a sleek and easy-to-follow format. The website is easily navigatable for new users and interested potential new members are subtly encouraged to sign-up to a free trial which is one of the business' owners key marketing tools. 

The website is a key tool in maintaining the connection between the gym and its existing members. This is achieved by providing up-to-date information to existing members on the latest gym news, upcoming gym events and class schedules and through the regular posting of motivational content.

 
## UX TEMP
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## UX

The following User Stories were used to focus the development of the project;

1. As a gym owner, I want the business to be easily discoverable when the business name is searched for on the Google search engine, so that potential customers can find us.
2. As a gym owner, I want to allow potential members to sign-up for the free trial, so that we can introduce them to what the gym has to offer.
As a gym owner, I want to use the website as key marketing tool in order to build the gym's brand, culture and Unique Selling Point.
As a gym owner, I want to showcase the gyms facilities and equipment to potential users to encourage them to sign-up.

As an existing member, I want to connect to the gym's social network platforms so that I can see what's happening and contribute to the members' community.

As a potential member, I want to learn about the services the gym provides so that I can decide if I am going to sign up.

As a potential member, I want to know the gym's location to help me decide if I'm going to sign-up.

The project provides solutions to the above User Stories as follows;



## Features TEMP

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.


## Features

The below sections detail both the existing features and potential future fetaures yet to be developed.

 
### Existing Features TEMP
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Existing Features TEMP





### Features Left to Implement TEMP
- Another feature idea 

### Features Left to Implement
- Community Forum 
- Class Booking online

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
